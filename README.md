# Art Career Insights Platform

## Project Overview

The Art Career Insights Platform is a web-based analytics application designed to support freelance artists, job seekers, and recruiters by providing meaningful insights into the creative job market.

The platform focuses on:

- Visualizing job posting trends over time
- Understanding salary benchmarks across different art roles
- Identifying in-demand skills required by employers
- Allowing exploration by job role, company, location, and employment type

This tool empowers users to make data-informed decisions about their careers, pricing, and skill development.

## What We Have Done

- Collected and cleaned a dataset of 957 unique art-related job postings from LinkedIn.
- Created a Tableau-ready dataset with relevant fields such as job title, salary, location, skills, and company.
- Designed and built the first Tableau dashboard: Job Trends & Insights, which includes:
  - Job Postings Over Time
  - Job Postings by Location
  - Job Postings by Company
  - Job Postings by Employment Type
- Published the dashboard using Tableau Public.
- Developed calculated fields such as simulated posting dates to allow for timeline-based visualizations.
- Documented the purpose and benefit of each visualization, especially for job seekers in the art field.

## What We Are Going To Do

- Complete the remaining Tableau dashboards:
  - Dashboard 2: Salary and Pricing Insights
  - Dashboard 3: Skills and Job Demand Analysis
- Develop the web application with the following stack:
  - Frontend: React.js
  - Backend: Node.js and Express
  - Database (if needed): MongoDB
- Embed Tableau dashboards into the web application using public shareable links.
- Add frontend features like filters for role, location, and employment type.
- Deploy the full-stack application for demonstration and evaluation.
- Finalize project documentation and prepare the academic presentation.
